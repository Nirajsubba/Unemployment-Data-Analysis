# Unemployment-Data-Analysis
Project Overview
This project is a Tableau-based data visualization dashboard designed to analyze unemployment data. It provides a clear view of labor market health by breaking down key demographics and trends over time. The dashboard is intended for economists, policy makers, and business analysts to identify which segments of the population are most affected by unemployment and to track economic cycles.
Primary Objectives:
•	Analyze the overall unemployment rate and total number of unemployed individuals.
•	Compare unemployment disparities between different genders.
•	Identify which age groups are most vulnerable to job loss.
•	Track unemployment trends over months and years to identify seasonal patterns and long-term economic shifts.

2. KPI Description (Summary Metrics)
The dashboard provides high-level summary metrics that capture the scale of unemployment:
•	Total Unemployed: The dataset encompasses millions of individuals, with specific figures for different groups (e.g., 135.5 million for one demographic).
•	Unemployment Rate by Gender: Shows a comparative rate between groups (e.g., 44.39% for one gender versus another), highlighting a significant disparity.
•	Unemployment by Age Group: The 20 to 24 years and 16 to 19 years cohorts are highlighted, indicating these groups face the highest rates of unemployment.

3. Chart & Visualization Description
1. Unemployment By Gender (Pie Chart / Donut Chart)
•	Description: A chart showing the proportion of unemployed individuals split by gender (e.g., Male vs. Female), with one group representing 44.39%.
•	Purpose: To reveal gender-based disparities in employment outcomes within the analyzed economy.
2. Unemployment By Age Group (Horizontal Bar Chart)
•	Description: A ranked bar chart listing age groups from highest to lowest unemployment. 16 to 19 years and 20 to 24 years are likely the highest, indicating young people struggle most to find work.
•	Purpose: To pinpoint the most affected demographics, which is crucial for targeting government aid, training programs, and economic policy.
3. Unemployment By Month (Line Chart)
•	Description: A line chart tracking the unemployment rate or number over the months of the year.
•	Purpose: To identify seasonal patterns in unemployment (e.g., increases in certain months due to agricultural or holiday hiring cycles).
4. Unemployment By Year (Line Chart)
•	Description: A line chart showing the trend in unemployment over multiple years, from a past year (e.g., 2001) to a more recent one (e.g., 2012).
•	Purpose: To visualize the long-term health of the job market, highlighting periods of recession (peaks) and recovery (troughs).

4. Filters Description
The dashboard likely includes interactive filters such as:
•	Year: To view data for a specific year or range of years.
•	Age Group: To isolate and analyze the data for a specific demographic, like "20-24 years."
•	Gender: To view trends specifically for male or female unemployment.

5. Conclusion & Insights
This dashboard effectively reveals the structural and cyclical nature of unemployment.
Key Conclusions:
1.	Demographic Disparity: There is a clear gender gap in unemployment, with one gender experiencing a significantly higher rate (44.39%).
2.	Youth Unemployment Crisis: The data shows that younger age groups (16-24 years) are disproportionately affected by unemployment, suggesting a challenging school-to-work transition.
3.	Economic Cycles: The timeline charts show clear peaks and valleys, correlating with economic booms and recessions, demonstrating the sensitivity of the labor market to macroeconomic forces.
4.	Seasonal Trends: Fluctuations over months suggest certain industries drive seasonal employment patterns.
In summary, the analysis shows that unemployment is not evenly distributed. It disproportionately impacts young people and one gender significantly more than the other. This data is vital for creating targeted social and economic policies to address these specific inequalities.
